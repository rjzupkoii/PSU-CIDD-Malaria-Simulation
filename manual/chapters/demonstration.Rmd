# Demonstration

## Introduction

The configuration included in the `demo` directory (`demo.yml`) is configured for a single cell and derives the majority of the settings from the Burkina Faso project, allowing it to emulate a realistic starting point for a model. In addition to the configuration file, there is also a basic raster file (`population.asc`) which informs the model on how to create a single cell with 1,000 individuals in it. The raster files used by the simulation are compliant with the [Esri ASCII raster format](https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/manage-data/raster-and-images/esri-ascii-raster-format.htm) and can be edited using a text editor, or appropriate geographic information system (GIS) software.

In order to use this demonstration code you first need to build the simulation using the guide outlined in [Development], after which is recommended that you copy the binary (`masim`) and contents of the `demo` directory (i.e., `demo/demo.yml` and `demo/population.asc`) into the same location. The simulation can then be executed using the following command:

`./MaSim -i demo.yml -r CellularReporter`

Using the `CellularReporter` will generate a comma separated values (CSV) file in the directory containing model output for select parameters such as population, *Pf*PR~2-10~, and infected individuals to name a few. Running the simulation a second time will cause this file to be overwritten unless the job number (`-j`) switch is used. The `CellularReporter` is intended for models with only one location (i.e., cell) and will generate an error if multiple cells are present in the configuration.

## Column Descriptions

The following tables are present in the output from the `CellularReporter`:

Table: (\#tab:demoCellularReporter) Column format for the `CellularReporter` 

| Column | Description |
| --- | --- |
| DaysElapsed	| Model days elapsed, should correspond to the length of months. |
| Population | Total population in the simulation. |
| PfPR2to10	| The *Plasmodium falciparum* parasite prevalence for individuals aged 2 to 10 years. |
| TreatmentCoverage | The current treatment coverage in the simulation as an average for the under-5 and over-5 groups. |
| InfectedIndividuals	| The number of individuals in the simulation who have *any* level of parasitemia. |
| ClinicalIndividuals	| The number of individuals in the simulation who have a parasitemia level of clinical symptoms to manifest. |
| ClinicalU5 | The number of newly clinical individuals  under the age of 5. |
| ClinicalO5 | The number of newly clinical individuals over the age of 5. |
| NewInfections	| The number of new infections in the past month. |
| Treatment | The number of clinical individuals who received treatment. |
| NonTreatment | The number of clinical individuals who did not seek treatment. |
| TreatmentFailure | The number of clinical individuals who sought treatment and the treatment did not clear the infection in the configured amount of time. |
| ParasiteClones | The number of parasite clones present in the simulation, one individual may be infected by multiple clones. |
| Theta	| The mean measure of immunity to the parasite in the simulation, zero means no immunity. |
| 580yWeighted | The weighted number of occurrences of the 580Y genotype, such that the sum of all clones in an individual equals one. | 
| 508yUnweighted | The total number of occurrences of the 580Y genotype in the simulation. |
| Plasmepsin2xCopyWeighted | The weighted number of occurrences of the Plasmepsin double copy mutation, such that the sum of all clones in an individual equals one. |
| Plasmepsin2xCopyUnweighted | The total number of occurrences of the Plasmepsin double copy mutation in the simulation. |
