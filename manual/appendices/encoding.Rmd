# Genotype Information

Genotypes are encoded into the application via the input file which contains a YAML entry for `genotype_info`. This structure is organized as `loci` with the associated `alleles` that may be mutated during model execution. The following table outlines loci and alleles that are included in the sample configuration file.

Table: (\#tab:encoding) Genotype encoding scheme

| Locus | Allele | Short Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PfCRT | K76 | K | Chloroquine sensitivity, Amodiaquine sensitive, Lumefantrine resistance  |
| | 76T | T |  Chloroquine resistance, Amodiaquine resistance, Lumefantrine sensitive |
| PfMDR1 | N86 Y184 one copy of pfmdr1 |  NY-- | Lumefantrine resistance, Amodiaquine sensitive |
| | 86Y Y184 one copy of pfmdr1 | YY-- | Amodiaquine resistance |
| | N86 184F one copy of pfmdr1 | NF-- | lumefantrine resistance |
| | 86Y 184F one copy of pfmdr1 | YF-- | Amodiaquine resistance, Lumefantrine resistance |
| | N86 Y184 2 copies of pfmdr1 | NYNY | lumefantrine resistance, Amodiaquine sensitive, Mefloquine resistance |
| | 86Y Y184 2 copies of pfmdr1 | YYYY | Amodiaquine resistance, Mefloquine resistance |
| | N86 184F 2 copies of pfmdr1 | NFNF | lumefantrine resistance, Mefloquine resistance |
| | 86Y 184F 2 copies of pfmdr1 | YFYF | Amodiaquine resistance, Lumefantrine resistance, Mefloquine resistance |
| K13 Propeller | C580 | C | Artemisinin sensitive |
| | 580Y | Y | Artemisinin resistance |
| Plasmepsin 2-3 | Plasmepsin 2-3 one copy | 1 | Piperaquine sensitive |
| | Plasmepsin 2-3 2 copies | 2 | Piperaquine resistant |
| Hypothetical locus for multiple use | naïve | x | Experimental use in the model |
| | mutant | X | Experimental use in the model |

The short name field requires additional note since genotype results generated by the model are based upon the short names. For example:

> KNY--C1x

Indicates that the parasite has the K76 allele from the PfCRT locus (K), N86 Y184 one copy of pfmdr1 (NY--), C580 from K13 Propeller locus (C), Plasmepsin 2-3 one copy (1), and is a naïve copy of the hypothetical locus (x).
