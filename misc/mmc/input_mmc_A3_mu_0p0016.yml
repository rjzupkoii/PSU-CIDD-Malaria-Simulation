# initialize parasite population

#
# this is all currently based on the fact that development inside the moquito takes 7 days (DiM=7)
# but, we will want to do sensitivity analyses that allow us to look at DiM=10, DiM=14 and so on.
#
# so, for the IC (inital conditions) below we can just assume that if we had 600 infected persons 3 days ago,
# that the number of infected persons 1 day ago and 5 days ago wa salso 600; in other words, we can remove column
# one from here
