# initialize parasite population

# day= 0 is 7 days ago
#
# this is all currently based on the fact that development inside the moquito takes 7 days (DiM=7)
# but, we will want to do sensitivity analyses that allow us to look at DiM=10, DiM=14 and so on.
#
# so, for the IC (inital conditions) below we can just assume that if we had 600 infected persons 3 days ago,
# that the number of infected persons 1 day ago and 5 days ago wa salso 600; in other words, we can remove column
# one from here

#
#
# NOV 19 2009: the new input method should look like this

#       ( the expected starting concentration is 1.0 )
#
# age_specific_drug_concentration_sd: 
#       the actual drug concentration, per individual, will be drawn from a normal distribution with mean=1 and this sd.
#
# k: 
#       parameter that describes the change in the mutation probability when drug levels are intermediate
#       - set k=0.5 for a simple linear model where mutation probablity decreases linearly with drug concentration
#       - set k=2 or k=4 for a piecewise-linear model where mutation probability increases from high concentrations
#               to intermediate concentrations, and then decreases linearly from intermediate concentrations to zero
