# MaSim Configuration File

# Introduction

The malaria simulation (MaSim) uses [YAML](https://yaml.org/) to load configuration settings for the simulation. While the configuration was previously forward compatible (i.e., older files would work with newer versions), with the transition to version 4.0 new nodes were added or deprecated that have resulted in a divergence between 3.x and 4.0 onwards. While the absence of nodes implies version 4.0 or greater, care should be taken to ensure it is clear which version a given configuration is intended for.

As a matter of convention, the YAML key is generally indicated with **bold** text. The data type (e.g., integer, string, etc.) or the possible values are indicated in parentheses following the key name. If there is a default value, then it will be given in _italic_ text. Generally this document is organized such that keys are organized by operational impact upon the simulation, followed by simple key-value pairs as the first entry in each section, followed by more complex entities as subheadings.   

# Nodes

## Model Operation Nodes 
The following nodes govern how the model executes at a low level.

**connection_string** (string) : (*Version 4.0*) The connection string for the PostgreSQL database that stores the simulation data.

**record_genome_db** (boolean) : (*Version 4.0*) Indicates that genome data should be recorded to the database when using the `DbReporter` reporter class. Note that recording genomic data to the database will cause the database to quickly inflate in size. It is recommended that this setting only be used when genomic data needs to be retrieved. 

## Model Configuration Notes
The following nodes contain the settings for the simulation.

**transmission_parameter** (float) : Governs how likely malaria is to be transmitted to a naive individual in the sporozoite challenge.

**number_of_age_classes** (integer) : The size of the `age_structure` array.\
**age_structure** : An array of integer values that corresponds to the oldest age that defines a break in the age structure.

## Simulation Geography

### raster_db
*Version 4.0* This node contains data related to the spatial organization of the model to include population distributions and raster files.

*Usage*\
The use of the `raster_db` node will override the use of the `location_db` and errors or inconsistencies will occur if both are used at the same time. All the raster files must have the same header information as defined in the [Esri ASCII raster format](https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/manage-data/raster-and-images/esri-ascii-raster-format.htm) and the same number of defined pixels. A `std::runtime_error` may be generated if the number of data pixels in a given raster exceeds, or is less than a previously loaded raster.

Note that while any arbitrary value may be used for the `NODATA_VALUE` it is recommended that the standard value of `-9999` be used.

```YAML
raster_db:
  beta_raster: "beta.asc"
  district_raster: "district.asc"
  location_raster: "location.asc"
  population_raster: "population.asc"
  travel_raster: "travel.asc"
  ecoclimatic_raster: "ecoclimatic.asc"
  pr_treatment_under5: "pr_treatment_under5.asc"
  pr_treatment_over5: "pr_treatment_over5.asc"

  cell_size: 5
  age_distribution_by_location: [[0.0]]
  p_treatment_for_less_than_5_by_location: [0.0]
  p_treatment_for_more_than_5_by_location: [0.0]

  beta_by_location: [0.0]
```
**beta_raster** (string) : The beta parameter (float) used for each cell in the model, overrides the value set in `beta_by_location`.\
**district_raster** (string) : Contains the canonical identification values (integer) that should be for each cell in the model.\
**location_raster** (string) : May contain arbitrary numeric values and is used by the simulation to convert the X-Y coordinates to their linear values. Only needed if it is the *only* raster file provided.\
**population_raster** (string) : Contains the number of individuals (integer) in each cell within the simulation.\
**travel_raster** (string) : Contains the friction surface (float) that is used for determining the likelihood of travel to a given cell.\
**ecoclimatic_raster** (string) : Contains the ecoclimatic zone value for each cell. The ecoclimatic zone value should be a zero-indexed integer that corresponds to the `seasonal_info` value to use.\
**pr_treatment_under5** (string) : Contains the access to treatment (float) for individuals under five years (60 months) for each cell in the simulation, overrides `p_treatment_for_less_than_5_by_location`.\
**pr_treatment_over5** (string) : Contains the access to treatment (float) for individuals over five years (60 months) for each cell in the simulation, overrides `p_treatment_for_more_than_5_by_location`.

**cell_size** (float) : The size of each cell along one axis, in kilometers.\
**age_distribution_by_location** : An array of arrays which contains floating point values corresponding to the age distribution (as defined by `age_structure`).\
**p_treatment_for_less_than_5_by_location**, **p_treatment_for_more_than_5_by_location** : (*Deprecated in Version 4.0*) Contains the access to treatment for individuals under or over (respectively) five years (60 months). If the array length is one, then the value supplied (float) is used for all locations in the model. Otherwise, each element in the array is presumed to correspond to a different location. 

**beta_by_location** : (*Array deprecated in Version 4.0, single value recommended or raster*) Contains the beta value (float) to be used in the simulation. If the array length is one, then the value supplied (float) is used for all locations in the model. Otherwise, each element in the array is presumed to correspond to a different location. 

### location_db
To Be Written.


### seasonal_info 
This setting governs the malaria season in the model.

```YAML
seasonal_info:
  enable: true
  raster: false
  a: [0.0]
  phi: [0.0]
  min_value: [0.0]
  period: 365
```

**enable** (true | false) : enables or disables seasonality in the simulation.\
**raster** (true | false) : (*Version 4.0*) indicates that a raster file should be used to set the correct rate for each pixel.\
**a**, **phi**, **min_value** : arrays of one to *n* `double` values that inform the seasonality period.\
&nbsp;*Version 3.x*: when one value is provided, it is used for all locations, otherwise a value must be provided for each location\
&nbsp;*Version 4.0*: if `raster` is true then each index in the array is used for the pixel coded with that value, otherwise the first value is used for all pixels.\
**period** : the number of days defined by the period.

## Individual Immunity and Infection Response

**allow_new_coinfection_to_cause_symtoms** (_true_ | false) : Flag to indicate if an asymptomatic host that is bitten and infected by a new parasite clone may present with new symptoms. Note the spelling of `symtoms` in the configuration.\

### parasite_density_level
The `parasite_density_level` setting contains several sub-values that govern individual behavior or state due to the total number of parasites that are present in the individual's blood stream. When setting the parasite density for the detectable levels note that 10 per μl is the middle of the bounds for detection under [Giemsa-stained thick blood film](https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/274382/MM-SOP-07a-eng.pdf) under laboratory conditions (4 - 20 parasites/μl) while 50 per μl is the lower bounds for detection under field conditions (50 - 100 parasites/μl) ([Wongsrichanalai et al. 2007](#Wongsrichanalai2007)). Generally, a higher detection limit for the <em>Pf</em>PR will require a higher transmission for a given <em>Pf</em>PR than a lower detection level. 

```YAML
parasite_density_level:
  log_parasite_density_cured:          -4.699    # corresponds to 100 total parasites (0.00002 per μl)
  log_parasite_density_from_liver:     -2.000    # corresponds to 50,000 total parasites (0.01 per μl)
  log_parasite_density_asymptomatic:    3        # corresponds to 1,000 parasites per microliter of blood
  log_parasite_density_clinical:        4.301    # corresponds to 20,000 parasites per microliter of blood (total 10^11)
  log_parasite_density_clinical_from:   3.301    # corresponds to 2,000 parasites per microliter of blood (total 10^10)
  log_parasite_density_clinical_to:     5.301    # corresponds to 200,000 parasites per microliter of blood (total 10^12)
  log_parasite_density_detectable:      1.000    # corresponds to 10 parasites per microliter of blood
  log_parasite_density_detectable_pfpr: 1.699    # corresponds to 50 parasites per microliter of blood
  log_parasite_density_pyrogenic:       3.398    # corresponds to 2,500 parasites per microliter of blood
```

**log_parasite_density_detectable_pfpr** (double) : Sets the threshold for the number of parasites that an individual may have present in their blood when tested to see if a _detectable_ level is presented. This value is used to inform calculations for the <em>Pf</em>PR in the simulation. \
**log_parasite_density_pyrogenic** (double) : (**UNUSED**) Sets the threshold for when fever may present as a symptom.

### immune_system_information
The `immune_system_information` node contains parameters that are used to control the response of the individual immune system and is one of the mechanisms by which the simulation can be calibrated to match a given country.  

```YAML
immune_system_information:

## Treatments

### drug_db
This setting is used to configure the various drugs used in the configuration and is structured as an array of drugs, which contain the specific setting for that particular compound. **Note** that while the simulation assumes that the compounds will be ordered from 0 to *n*, it is the responsibility of the user to ensure that they are assigned and ordered correctly.

```YAML
drug_db:
  0:
    name: "ART"       # Artemisinin
    half_life: 0.0
    maximum_parasite_killing_rate: 0.999
    n: 25
    age_specific_drug_concentration_sd: [0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4]
    age_specific_drug_absorption: [0.7,0.7,0.85,0.85,0.85,0.85,0.85,0.85,0.85,0.85,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]
    mutation_probability: 0.005
    affecting_loci: [2]
    selecting_alleles: [[1]]
    k: 4
    EC50:
      ..0..: 0.75
